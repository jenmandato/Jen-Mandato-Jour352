<h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>This section will have bullet points summarizing the main points of the story to help with readability.</p>

<!--Section 1-->
<h1>Title T.B.A.</h1>
  <p>Walking down Abbot Kinney Boulevard, the retail strip in Venice, California, can feel like scrolling through Instagram. One afternoon this July, people sat at outdoor tables beneath drooping strings of fairy lights, sipping cocktails and spearing colorful, modestly dressed salads. The line for Salt & Straw, a venture-funded, “chef-driven” ice-cream shop, stretched up the block, and athleisure-clad twentysomethings photographed themselves eating waffle cones, fabric masks pulled down around their chins like turkey wattles. A month earlier, Abbot Kinney had become a central gathering place for protesters during the mass demonstrations against police brutality and systemic racism. Moxie Marlinspike, who firmly supported the protests, noticed that many of the high-end businesses, fearing looters, had boarded up their windows, then decorated the plywood with murals and messages in support of Black Lives Matter. “It kind of reminded me of how, right after the Russian Revolution, a lot of the zeks—the sort of criminal underclass—would get full-chest tattoos of Marx and Lenin and, later, Stalin because they thought the Bolsheviks would be less likely to kill them,” he joked, as we wandered along the Venice Beach boardwalk.</p>
<p>Marlinspike is the C.E.O. of Signal, the end-to-end encrypted messaging service, which he launched in 2014; he is also a cryptographer, a hacker, a shipwright, and a licensed mariner. Tall and sinewy, with the build of a natural athlete who abstains from team sports, he was wearing black jeans, a black T-shirt, black Teva sandals, a denim jacket, and a white N95 mask. He has blond dreadlocks, which he had tucked under a blue cap. An avid surfer, he had been living in the neighborhood with friends for about two years, but, aside from the ocean, it held little appeal for him. “Living in Venice is like living at the end of the world, the end of history,” he told me, dryly. “All the decisions have been made. This is the world we get.”</p>
<p>Signal’s growth has corresponded to periods in which decisions are questioned or undone—to moments of social and political upheaval. With end-to-end encryption, the content of every communication—a text message, a video chat, a voice call, an emoji reaction—is intelligible only to the sender and the recipient. If an exchange is intercepted, by a hacker or a government agency, the interloper sees a nonsensical snarl of letters and numbers. Signal does not share growth metrics, but in late 2016 Marlinspike told the Times that the number of daily Signal downloads had grown by four hundred per cent since the election of Donald Trump. This summer in the U.S., the service was flooded with an estimated several million new users. In early July, after China imposed a sweeping national-security law, Signal was briefly the most downloaded app in Hong Kong. The Electronic Frontier Foundation includes Signal in its “Surveillance Self-Defense” guide; Edward Snowden, a friend of Marlinspike, has endorsed it for years.</p>
<p>All this has given Signal a halo of subversion, but Marlinspike believes that encrypted-communication tools are necessary not just in times of political tumult. Most people who use social networks and chat services, he argues, assume that their digital communications are private; they want to share their thoughts and photographs with their friends—not with Facebook and Google, not with advertisers, and certainly not on the dark Web. “In a sense, I feel like Signal is just trying to bring normality to the Internet,” he said as we sat on a patch of grass near the beach. “A lot of what we’re trying to do is just square the actual technology with people’s intent.” He plucked two small feathers out of the grass, rolled them between his fingers, and planted them upright in the dirt.</p>
<p>Since Signal was released, it has evolved from a niche tool, touted by the privacy-minded and the paranoid, into a mainstream product recommended by the Wall Street Journal. Activists use Signal to coördinate protests, lovers to conduct affairs, workers to unionize, finance professionals to exchange sensitive information, drug dealers to contact customers, journalists to communicate with sources. The app has appeared, shimmering with significance, on the TV shows “Mr. Robot,” “House of Cards,” and “Euphoria.” Signal is also reportedly used by the Democratic National Committee, the United States Senate, the European Commission, law-enforcement agencies, Rudy Giuliani, and Melania Trump. “Signal is a piece of public infrastructure, critical infrastructure,” Snowden, who met Marlinspike in 2015, in Moscow, told me over the encrypted video-chat service Jitsi.</p>
<p>Marlinspike is punctual, affable, and unassuming; even his gait is mild. Sometimes while he speaks he gently snaps his fingers, like a metronome. He talked about the “diabolical” ways that the Internet has eroded the barrier between our personal and professional identities. “People who aren’t even professional writers have to consider that their communication is being consumed,” he told me. “Anything that I’ve ever written or created, one way or another, about anything is sort of embarrassing to me a month later. Even more so five years later.”</p>
<p>When we first spoke, Marlinspike stressed that he didn’t want to discuss his personal life, a stipulation to which I agreed. Later, after a series of mutually fraught conversations, it became clear that we did not have a common definition of personal information. For him, it included basic biographical facts: age, home town, birth name. (Moxie was a childhood nickname; he declined to elaborate on his surname’s origins.) During several days of conversations in Venice, he was chatty, pleasant, and guarded, avoiding specificities and controversial comments. In the coming weeks, we continued talking, always on the phone, via Signal, and mostly off the record. The telephone is an inherently intimate medium, and the reassurance of an encrypted connection made it feel more so. Still, Marlinspike remained a little opaque to me. I felt that I understood him better through his blog and his social-media runoff—exactly the material he wanted to keep separate from his professional life.</p>
<p>Brit Marling, the actor and writer, who has been a friend of Marlinspike’s for more than a decade, described his “daring and dazzling” discussions with friends. “There’s nothing that you can say to him that’s going to hit a wall,” she said. But she related to his desire for privacy: “As people start to tell you who you are, you start to be boxed in by that impression. I think that’s something Moxie has actively resisted, with a lot of energy.” Snowden described Marlinspike as “phenomenally interesting,” “remarkable,” “wickedly funny,” and a “wild, almost literary figure,” but, not wanting to discourage others from following Marlinspike’s example in challenging the status quo, advised against mythologizing him: “He is an exceptional individual. But, also, what is the seed of him that is ordinary?”</p>
<p>Marlinspike will share that he was born in the early eighties, in Georgia. He spent much of his youth immersed in anarchist literature and communities, and anarchism’s inherent critique of authority is still important to him. This orientation is unusual in the tech world, although its right-wing analogue, libertarianism, is pervasive. “Liberalism basically says that we should all be free to talk about the world we want, and then we have a marketplace of ideas that we can select from,” he said. “I think anarchism’s comment on that is it’s not enough just to talk about things—that you can’t actually know unless you experience or experiment with something.”</p>

<h1>Title T.B.A.</h1>
  <p>Signal, as a nonprofit, is an outlier in the tech industry. It runs entirely on donations. “Signal’s mission has always been to make end-to-end encryption as ubiquitous as possible, rather than a commercial success,” Marlinspike said. Its code base is open-source—publicly available for anyone to download and comment on—and subject to peer review. Most tech companies readily coöperate, and make contracts, with governments, but Signal was founded on the premise that mass surveillance, particularly by governments and corporations, should be impossible. Signal itself cannot read the messages that its users send, and does not collect user metadata. It keeps no call logs or data backups. Signal claims that it has no “backdoors”—built-in circumvention methods designed to give law enforcement or corporations access to encrypted content. In 2016, Signal received a subpoena as part of a federal grand-jury investigation, accompanied by a gag order. A similar request to Google or Facebook likely would have yielded subscriber records with information such as names, credit-card numbers, I.P. addresses, and activity logs. A search warrant would produce e-mails and chat transcripts. Signal could only proffer the relevant phone number’s account-creation date and the date when it had last connected to Signal’s servers. This was a point of pride: Marlinspike posted responses to the gag order and subpoena on Signal’s blog. “Electronic service providers—who have dual roles as custodians of Americans’ private data and as necessary actors in the execution of government surveillance requests—have a critical role to play, and perspective to share publicly, about government surveillance practices,” the author of the responses, an A.C.L.U. lawyer, wrote.</p>
  <p>Advocates of end-to-end encryption argue that any backdoor into an otherwise secure system will immediately become a target for foreign adversaries, terrorists, and hackers. But critics claim that end-to-end encryption could shield terrorist plots, child sexual exploitation, and other criminal activities. Some people note that strong encryption could preclude content moderation, potentially allowing disinformation, hate speech, propaganda, harassment, and incitements of violence to flourish. Governments have pushed hard for backdoor access to encrypted systems; China, Iran, and Russia have banned various messaging apps and services that provide end-to-end encryption. In 2016, Britain passed the Investigatory Powers Act, which authorizes the government to compel communications providers to remove “electronic protection” from any communications and data; in 2018, Australia passed controversial data-encryption laws that allow law-enforcement agencies to demand that private companies include backdoors in their products. Earlier this year, Attorney General William Barr praised a new bill in Congress, the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act, that, among other things, would require communications providers, hardware manufacturers, tech companies, and others to decrypt data upon provision of a warrant. (Marlinspike told me, “Every time Bill Barr talks about cryptography, I’m, like, Damn, I really wish I could read his Signal messages.”)</p>
  <p>Enforcing laws, Marlinspike believes, should be difficult. He likes to say that “we should all have something to hide,” a statement that he intends not as a blanket endorsement of criminal activity but as an acknowledgment that the legal system can be manipulated, and that even the most banal activities or text messages can be incriminating. In his view, frequent lawbreaking points to systemic rot. He often cites the legalization of same-sex marriage and, in some states, marijuana as evidence that people sometimes need to challenge laws or engage in nominally criminal activity for years before progress can be made. “Before, it was inconceivable,” he said. “After, it was inconceivable that it was ever inconceivable.” Privacy, he says, is a necessary condition for experimentation, and for social change. He compares the need for a secure digital space to the need for a private domestic one—where, for instance, a child might safely experiment with gender identity or expression. “If I’m dissatisfied with this world—and I think that I might be—a problem is that you can only desire based on what you know,” Marlinspike said. “You have certain experiences in this world, they produce certain desires, those desires reproduce the world. Our reality today just keeps reproducing itself. If you can create different experiences that manifest different desires, then it’s possible that those will lead to the production of different worlds.”</p>
